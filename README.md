# Mondrian-Project: Composition No III with Red, Blue, Yellow, and Black.
Tools: HTML5, CSS Flexbox and CSS Grid

This project was inspired by Piet Mondrian, an influential DutcH Painter, whose work of art evolved over his lifetime into his own unique style which he coined "neo-plasticism"

Composition No III sold for $50.6 million at a New York auction in 2015. This sale price was more than double its estimated value of $15 million to $25 million, according to the BBC. The auction also included a 12% buyer's premium.
